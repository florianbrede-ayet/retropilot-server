# retropilot-server
Replacement for comma.ai backend and useradmin dashboard. Bundled with a modified version of comma's cabana to allow viewing & analyzing drives.

If you don't want to host your own instance, check out https://api.retropilot.org/useradmin for a hosted version of the backend, useradmin and cabana.

### [Server] Summary

The server consists of 2 node scripts.

- `src/server` is using expressjs and runs the backend (file upload / communication with openpilot) and the useradmin dashboard to manage / view / download drives & logs.

- `src/worker` is a background worker that is processing drives (analyzing video files & logs) to prepare drives for playback in cabana and to gather statistics. It automatically terminates itself after 60 minutes to make sure the video/log libraries do not cause memory leaks.

**Attention:** Minimum required node version is **node 10**.

### [Server] Installation

```
npm install
cp config.sample.js config.js
cp database.empty.sqlite database.sqlite
> EDIT config.js
```


### [Server] Running

```
node -r esm src/server
```
```
node -r esm src/worker
```


### [Server] CABANA Support
A compiled version of a custom cabana fork (https://github.com/florianbrede-ayet/retropilot-cabana) is directly bundled in the `cabana/` subdirectory and will be served by the express app. After starting `index.js`, cabana is ready to use.

### [Device] Preparation / Enable Custom Server

On the device or in your fork's code, replace all API endpoints with your own server endpoint. 
This could be executed directly on the device in the shell to use `https://api.retropilot.org` as backend:
```
find /data/openpilot -type f -exec sed -i 's/https:\/\/api.commadotai.com/https:\/\/api.retropilot.org/g' {} +
```

### [Device] Swapping Servers (Back)
To switch a device between different servers, you have to remove the old `DongleId` and reboot:
```
rm /data/params/d/DongleId
reboot
```

There is no need to backup the `DongleId`, as the new server will identify your device based on its imei, serial and public key.

### [Device] Raw Drives Not Uploading (fcamera & rlog)
1. Raw data is only uploaded if the device is sufficiently charged, not connected to an active panda (offroad) and there are no immediate files (boot, crash, qcamera, qlog) remaining.<br>
2. Your branch might have raw uploads disabled, check *Device Settings > Upload Raw Logs*.


If that doesn't help or the option is not available, try:

```
echo "1" > /data/params/d/IsUploadRawEnabled
echo "1" > /data/params/d/UploadRaw
reboot
```

-----


### Current Limitations
OpenPilot before 0.8.3 will not display any statistics or pairing status in the dashboard.
The reason is that pre 0.8.3, the `offroad.apk` with react and comma-api would require recompilation to accept the new endpoints.

The athena websockets interface is not implemented yet, so the comma app and athena specific remote control commands (including "upload on demand") are not functional as of now.
